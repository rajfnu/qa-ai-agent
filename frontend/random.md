# Sales Coach in Pocket ‚Äì ImpactWon
_Agentic AI Platform for Right-to-Win Sales Coaching_


> Audience: AI Engineers and Data Scientists  
> Scope: End-to-end blueprint (agents, workflows, components, data, scoring, cost controls, delivery)

---

## 1. Vision
Digitize ImpactWon‚Äôs proprietary **4Cs (Credibility, Capability, Commitment, Control)** framework and **Right-to-Win (R2W)** methodology into a **multi-agent AI platform** that coaches sellers, scores deals, and enables executives to lead CEO-led sales effectively.

The system acts as a **‚ÄúCoach in Your Pocket‚Äù** ‚Äî providing real-time, contextual, and personalized guidance to sales teams through integrated AI agents.

- **Decision for what to be Agent, Workflow, ot Component** (decision rubric + updated roster).
- **Right-Model** (CEO Sales Plan, Attainment, Team, Remuneration, Pursuit, Power Plan) drives **prioritization, gating, & feature weights** across the 4Cs calculators. 
- **Right-Tools** (FOG, Engagement Excellence, Buyers/Beneficiaries/Backers, Find the Money, Client Profiles, Impact vs Activity) feed **signals** into Knowledge, Trust, Mastery, Influence, Outcome, Satisfaction. 
- Scoring aligns to **Credibility = Knowledge √ó Trust, Capability = Competence √ó Quantum, Commitment = Outcome √ó Satisfaction, Control = Mastery √ó Influence**; **YES/NO gate** (NO ‚áí max 50). 
- **Data buckets** & **LLM cost-controls** (RAG-first, short-prompt schema, output caching, vector hit-rate SLO, dedup embeddings) specified.

## 1.1) Agent, Workflow, Or Component ‚Äì Decision Rubric

**Agent = autonomous decision-maker** that:
- Consumes **multi-source context**, applies **policy/method**, chooses **actions/next steps**, and produces **prescriptions** (e.g., NBM, plan rewrite).
- Requires **LLM reasoning** + tool use + **explainable rationale**.
- Can be **HITL-gated** (human-in-the-loop) before writing back to systems.

**Component = shared capability** that:
- Offers a **deterministic service** (CRUD, scoring math, search, indexing, sync).
- Is **stateless or state-scoped**, versioned, testable via contracts.
- Does **not** decide strategy; it **enables** agents.

## 6. ‚öôÔ∏è Scoring Algorithm Spec (4Cs + R2W)

### **6.1 Base Equation**

Right-to-Win (R2W) = Average(Credibility, Capability, Commitment, Control)

> Guard rule: if any C < 60 ‚Üí cap R2W = 60  
> Licence-to-Sell = true if R2W ‚â• 70 and all Cs ‚â• 60

---

### **6.2 Component Formulas**

#### **Credibility = Knowledge √ó Trust**
| Sub-Factor | Data Signals | Formula |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Knowledge | % client-specific terms, embedding similarity, case relevance | 0.5√ócontent relevance + 0.3√óindustry match + 0.2√óreference count |
| Trust | Access level, executive engagement, sentiment | Sigmoid(access + sentiment + inbound ratio) |

‚Üí **Credibility = Knowledge √ó Trust √ó 100**

---

#### **Capability = Competence √ó Quantum**
| Sub-Factor | Data Signals | Formula |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Competence | KPI impact, innovation vs benchmarks | Weighted mean of KPI uplift + innovation index |
| Quantum | Project scale, delivery history | (past_delivery_score + region_reference_score) / 2 |

---

#### **Commitment = Outcome √ó Satisfaction**
| Sub-Factor | Data Signals | Formula |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Outcome | Delivery reliability, contract recency | exp(-delay_days/œÑ) √ó reliability_index |
| Satisfaction | Advocacy level, NPS, adoption | (positive_feedback_rate √ó meeting_recency_weight) |

Cap Commitment ‚â§ 50 if no active deal (as per Stepping Stone rule).

---

#### **Control = Influence √ó Mastery √ó Question**
| Sub-Factor | Data Signals | Formula |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Influence | % Buyer/Backer/Beneficiary covered, meeting ownership | (role_coverage √ó engagement_depth) |
| Mastery | Proposal differentiation, competitor gap | NLP uniqueness index |
| Question | Binary: differentiator present in RFP | 1 if yes, 0 if no |

‚Üí **Control = 0.5√óInfluence + 0.3√óMastery + 0.2√óQuestion**

10. Misc
## 10.1) Data Buckets & Sources (Company / Client / Industry / Deal)

**Company** (your org): references, cases, solution catalog, capacity, certifications, pricing guardrails.  
**Client**: accounts, contacts (Buyer/Beneficiary/Backer), meetings, emails, notes, satisfaction, budgets (‚ÄúFind the Money‚Äù).   
**Industry**: benchmarks, trends, regulatory notes, competitor intel.  
**Deal**: opportunity meta, stage, proposals, pursuit/power plan snapshots, 4Cs history.

**Primary feeds**
- CRM (Salesforce/HubSpot): accounts/contacts/opportunities/activities.
- Email & Calendar (Microsoft Graph): meetings, attendees, recency/latency.
- File/Docs: proposals, SoWs, case studies (ADLS).
- Workbook constructs: Right-Model configs (CEO Sales Plan, Attainment, Team, Remuneration), Right-Tools libraries (FOG prompts/checklists, Engagement Excellence lenses, Client Profiles). 

---

## 10.2) Right-Model & Right-Tools ‚Üí How They Influence 4Cs

### 10.2.1 Right-Model (plans) as **policy & weights**
Elements: **CEO Sales Plan, Attainment Plan, Team Plan, Remuneration Plan, Pursuit Plan, Power Plan, Right Clients, Right Team, Right Deals**. 

- **Eligibility / Gating:** If a deal is **not** a Right Client/Right Deal per CEO Sales Plan ‚áí **R2W soft-cap** at 60 until plan alignment tasks complete (e.g., retarget stakeholders, re-scope).  
- **Weights:** Attainment Plan **elevates** the weak-C weight in the scorer for in-plan Bedrock deals.  
- **Plan Compliance Feature:** % of Pursuit milestones met affects **Commitment (Outcome)** and **Control (Influence)**.  
- **Power Plan** is the operational canvas for the 4Cs and preserves the **YES/NO max-50 rule** on the four qualifying questions. 

### 10.2.2 Right-Tools (methods) as **signal extractors & normalizers**
- **FOG** (Fact / Opinion / Gossip): All textual evidence is labeled; **facts boost Knowledge & Mastery**, **opinions are discounted**, **gossip excluded** from scoring. 
- **Engagement Excellence (Six Lenses):** Completeness across lenses feeds **Knowledge** and **Influence** coverage. 
- **Buyers/Beneficiaries/Backers:** Role graph coverage and recency feed **Influence** and **Trust**. 
- **Find the Money:** Budget existence/owner/prioritization boosts **Commitment (Outcome,Satisfaction)** gates. 
- **Client Profiles & Traps:** Risk flags can **cap Control** until mitigations are logged. 
- **Impact over Activity:** Score changes track **impactful** actions only; activity without impact ignored. 

---

## 10.3) 4Cs Scoring Engine (Component)

**Canonical formulas** (from Right-to-Win guide) with YES/NO gating:  
- **Credibility = Knowledge √ó Trust**  
- **Capability = Competence √ó Quantum**  
- **Commitment = Outcome √ó Satisfaction**  
- **Control = Mastery √ó Influence**  
- If the corresponding **qualifying question** is answered **NO**, that C‚Äôs **max = 50**; **YES ‚áí up to 100**. 

### 10.3.1 Feature mapping (selected)
- **Knowledge:** (a) FOG-Fact ratio; (b) Six-Lens coverage; (c) proposal‚Äìstrategy similarity; (d) case relevancy.   
- **Trust:** (a) exec access recency (CEO in 7 days); (b) inbound vs outbound ratio; (c) sentiment; (d) promise-kept streak. 
- **Competence:** (a) KPI uplift analogs; (b) top-quartile reference match; (c) method uniqueness excerpts.  
- **Quantum:** (a) count of regional/industry deployments; (b) scale match index (size vs history). 
- **Outcome:** (a) delivery to scope/SLA; (b) timeliness; (c) expansion. 
- **Satisfaction:** (a) NPS/CSAT proxies; (b) re-order cadence; (c) C-suite sponsorship.  
- **Mastery:** (a) distinct Impact Themes; (b) UVP presence; (c) ‚ÄúOnly we can‚Ä¶‚Äù anchors. 
- **Influence:** (a) Buyer/Beneficiary/Backer coverage; (b) RFP fingerprints; (c) plan compliance.
